**PART 2/2: Report formatting using Microsoft Word**

Use Microsoft Word and write a professionally formatted report called "**Buying a Computer Advice**" 

Please use the following as a formatting guideline:

- add both of your names to the Cover Page, along with the research title and your course name (*BSc in XXX*)
- make use of **Heading 1** and/or **Heading 2** styled text with a view to being able to create an automated table of contents under your Cover Page
- make use of **Captions** on all images with a view to being able to create an automated table of figures that is to appear below your automated Table of Contents

FOR EXAMPLE:
- PG1: a template **cover page** with both of your names and course title
- PG 2: an **automated Table of Contents** and an **automated Table of Figures**
- PG 3 onwards. details of your report 
- **Conclusion**: Include **an image of your chosen laptop**, with this image **hyperlinking** to the website that you sourced it from.
- Last Page "**References**". 

For all images and content that you are using from other sources, you are required to use Harvard system of Referencing with *citations* throughout and an associated full *Reference* list on the last page.
