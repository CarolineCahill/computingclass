# Fundamental Formatting

MS Excel Formatting

Download my [Arithmetic file](./archives/archive.zip) which you will amend, as instructed, and **upload to Moodle** before 9pm Friday 27th Oct 

<hr>

## Fundamental formatting on within the worksheet

- **Save** the workbook as ***SETU_Arithmetic***
- Edit **course title** to read YOUR course  
- Over this course title, add a **comment** with your lecturers name in it 
- **Delete** empty rows and columns 
- **Delete** empty worksheets within the workbook 
- **Rename** the worksheet as ***Fundamentals***
- Do a Spelling and Grammar check on the file and make any associated changes 
- Add a centre **header** with your name in it 

### Headings - merge and centre

- **Merge and centre** the heading ***Arithmetic Operators*** across the top of the columns (i.e. across ***X PLUS Y*** column as far as ***Y CUBED*** column)
- Add a light green **fill colour** to the merged cell
- Add a **thick box border** on this merged cell 

- Repeat this merging for ***Comparison Operators***, merging it from ***X equal Y*** to ***X not equal Y*** columns
- Add any **fill colour** and any **border** type of your own choice

### Conditional Formatting

1. For the **X data**, create a **Conditional Formatting rule** that will highlight in red text all values that are 10 and under. 
2. For the **Y data**, create a **Conditional Formatting rule** that will highlight in yellow cell fill colour all values that are between 20 and 40 inclusive.
