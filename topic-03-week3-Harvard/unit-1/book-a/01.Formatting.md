Privacy on the web

Once these data are collected they are often merged with other personal data about the individual to develop detailed profiles of customer behaviour for marketing campaigns. Many companies sell personal data in order to obtain income.

The Internet has quickly become one of the most important sources of personal data. If you bank through the net or invest through an on-line brokerage firm, you must give out a great deal more personal data. 

Although you give this information freely, you rarely have any management over what the site will do with it. Additionally many sites are gathering much more personal information without our even being aware of it using “cookies” and other tools for gathering personal data from web visitors. 

Laudon and Laudonette, 2004
